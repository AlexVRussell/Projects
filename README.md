# README
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame library.

*Game Objective*

-The objective of the game is to control a snake on a game board and eat food that randomly appears on the board. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, 
and the player earns points. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the board.

*Game Controls*

-Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake: up, down, left, or right.
The game starts automatically upon running the code.

*Game Features*

-Snake moves in the direction specified by the player's input.
Snake grows longer by 1 segment each time it eats food.
Food appears randomly on the game board after the snake eats the previous food.
The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the board.
The score is displayed on the console once the game has ended, indicating the number of foods eaten.

*Dependencies*

-Python 3.x
-Pygame library

*How to Run*

-Make sure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
Run the code in a Python environment.
The game window will open automatically, and the game will start.
Use arrow keys to control the snake and eat the food.
The game will end when the snake hits the edge of the board.
The final score will be displayed on the console.
Close the game window to exit the game.

*Improvements*

-Add a feature so the snake cannot collide with itself.
Make it so the snake moves inside a grid, not just where ever.
Add a feature so the score is displayed in real time not just after the game is over in the console.
If you have any improvements to this please reach out I'd love to improve my code and learn/grow to become better. Thanks.
